# Codechef-Problem-Statement-Downloader

This is the script that I have used to download the codechef problem statements.

## Requirements

* **Beautiful Soup Module**
    * If you are using Debian or any Debian based Linux distro such as Ubuntu then you can install Beautiful Soup by
    typing `apt-get install python-bs4` (for Python 2) or `apt-get install python3-bs4` (for Python 3)
    * If you prefer downloading via pip you can download it by executing these commands:
    `pip install beautifulsoup4` (for Python 2) or `pip3 install beautifulsoup4` (for Python 3)

* **urllib.request module**
    * This module is built-in for Python 3
    * Python 2 users can use urllib2 in the program
